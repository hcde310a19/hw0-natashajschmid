# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)

# The previous exercise was a bit difficult for me to come up with and felt somewhat unsatisfying,
# however I believe what I came up with should be satisfactory for the activity. THat being said, there
# is still the possibility of ambiguity or misinterpretation.
# I hope to leave this class with a basic understanding of how to code using Python, a skill that I would
# like to transfer to other coding classes, as well as potentially utilize in a future career. Since the
# only programming class I have taken is CSE 142, my brain still does not have a ton of practice with
# "thinking like a coder," however I believe this can come with time. I find coding very fascinating, yet
# in CSE 142 I also got very frustrated at times.
